# Reminder
This is a simple Ruby (1.9.3+) command-line application to display upcoming and past events like birthdays, namedays and payments.

This isn't really an application, it's just a bunch of scripts to print out events. It doesn't let you do anything. Data manipulation is done via editing tha data.rake file and reloading the data from scratch (i.e. running `rake db:recreate db:data:load`).

If you have a Mac, it can be hooked into [GeekTool](http://itunes.apple.com/cz/app/geektool/id456877552?mt=12) and displayed on your desktop.

## Editing your data
Open `lib/tasks/data.rake` in your text editor and modify it at your will. This is sample data:

    # encoding: utf-8

    namespace :db do
      namespace :data do

        desc 'Load data into database'
        task :load => :environment do
          events = [
            # Namedays
            { :month => 4,  :day => 25,  :nameday => true,  :name => 'Theo' },
            { :month => 3,  :day => 13,  :nameday => true,  :name => 'Vanessa' },

            # Birthdays
            { :month => 2,  :day => 27, :birthday => true, :name => 'Cousin Cliff', :year => 1980 },
            { :month => 1,  :day => 7,  :birthday => true, :name => 'Cousin Clair', :year => 1990 },

            # Payments
            { :month => 3,  :day => 12, :payment => true,  :name => 'hosting' },
            { :month => 3,  :day => 11, :payment => true,  :name => 'Something' },
          ]

          events.each do |event_hash|
            event = Event.new event_hash
            event.save
            p event
          end
        end

      end
    end

And then run `rake db:recreate db:data:load` to take effect.

## Changing the locale
Currently supported locales are :en and :cs, no problem adding more. Just edit the `config/application.rb`:

    module Reminder
      ...
      LOCALE = :cs # :en, :cs
      ...
    end

And run the application

    $ rake run
    +--------------+-------------------------+
    |      Narozeniny, svátky, platby…       |

    | 12. 03. 2012 | hosting platba          |
    | 11. 03. 2012 | Something platba        |
